The program in this branch is incomplete. The program was started by incrementally stepping the axles across the span and calculating for each step the shear and moment at each node.

This approach does not ensure that the maximum forces are calculated. It can be overcome by decreaing the increment such that the axle step is refined enough to ensure an accurate calculation.

This code was saved because it is a valid approach if it is executed properly and may be useful in the future.
